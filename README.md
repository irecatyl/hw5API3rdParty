Start by creating a searchbox with a button in HTML
An event listener function should be added to the button
Once the interface user inputs the desired information, 
an API call will occur
An API key will be needed to pull that information to the users site
The key will grant access to the those with permission
The key code can also track and may have a limit to how many calls it wil respond to
You will need to get the API key from the internet
search for free APIs to use, you will have to sign up with an email
once you are signed up an Key code will be generated
this code should be protected
copy the API key to input to code using javascript fetch command
this will help to "answer" the users API call
